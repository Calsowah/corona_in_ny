## Project description

Given the intractable rise of Covid-19 cases in the world (particularly in New York), I thought it would be helpful to create a website that visually tracks the number of cases and deaths associated with the virus in the six most affected areas in New York as well as in Tompkins, which is where I am based. The six areas accounted for are:
1. NYC
2. Suffolk
3. Westchester
4. Rockland
5. Nassau
6. Orange
